CozyTea Lesson on CC

This project is related to the Week 4 project from CodeCademy course "Website Development"

In the first commit I've added the index.html and style.css from the last project (My Times), to use as a base, and the images for the current project.

Later commits were being added as I was writing it, one for each section of the website.
